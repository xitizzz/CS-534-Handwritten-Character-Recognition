# Handwritten-Character-Recognition
Hand written character recognition project for CS 534 Computer Vision. This code uses a small dataset with 16 alphabets form English each having 80 samples for training. 

The test data is also small with total 160 alphabets. Even with this small dataset this code gives about 90% accuracy with the use of specialized feature map.
